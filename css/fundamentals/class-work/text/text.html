<h2>A wedding in Chicago</h2>
<p>
    My name’s David. We’re in a small village near Chicago. My cousin’s getting married. My father and her father are
    twins. A lot of relatives are here for the wedding party. We’re very busy. My uncle’s friend is making palov. My
    sister Susan and Aunt Keane are making cakes. My mother’s helping her niece with her wedding dress. My grandparents
    are here too. They’re very old. They live in Chicago. I’m making a video and taking photos. It’s great. I want to be
    a reporter.
